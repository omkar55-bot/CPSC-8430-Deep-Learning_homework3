# Code Review Summary - DLHW3 Improvements

## ✅ All Improvements Successfully Implemented

I've thoroughly reviewed and improved your DLHW3 code based on the slides you provided. Here's what was done:

---

## 🎯 Major Changes

### 1. **Doc Stride = 150** (All Levels)
- **Changed in**: All 4 config files + `dataset.py` default parameter
- **Old values**: 128, 64, 32, 16
- **New value**: 150 (recommended by slide)
- **Why**: Optimal overlap for sliding windows to prevent answers from being split

### 2. **Linear Learning Rate Decay** (Medium Level)
- **Location**: `train.py` lines ~88-114
- **Added**: Comprehensive documentation showing both manual and automatic methods
- **Implementation**: Already had automatic method with `get_linear_schedule_with_warmup`
- **Added comments**: Showing how to manually decrement LR if needed
- **Why**: Prevents overfitting and helps convergence

### 3. **Preprocessing: Center Answers** (Strong Level)
- **Location**: `dataset.py` - `_create_training_windows()` method
- **Improvement**: Properly center answers in windows during training
- **Old approach**: Simple window around answer
- **New approach**: Calculate midpoint and center window
- **Why**: Prevents model from learning that answers are always near boundaries

### 4. **Postprocessing: Handle Invalid Spans** (Boss Level)
- **Location**: `utils.py` - `get_best_answer_from_window()` function
- **Bug fixed**: Added check for `end_idx < start_idx`
- **Action**: Skip invalid spans instead of using them
- **Why**: Critical bug that can produce nonsensical answers

### 5. **FP16 Mixed Precision Training** (Performance)
- **Location**: `train.py` - Accelerator initialization
- **Added**: Comprehensive documentation explaining FP16 benefits
- **Speedup**: 1.5-3.0x faster training (slide shows 20m→8m for simple)
- **Implementation**: Already using Accelerator with fp16 flag
- **Config**: `use_fp16: true` in all configs
- **Warning**: Only works on compatible GPUs (T4, V100)

### 6. **Gradient Accumulation** (Memory Optimization)
- **Location**: `train.py` - Training loop
- **Added**: Documentation explaining the technique
- **Implementation**: Already using `accelerator.accumulate()`
- **Config**: `gradient_accumulation_steps` set in configs (1, 2, 4, 8)
- **Why**: Allows larger effective batch sizes on limited GPU memory

## 🔍 Slide-to-Code Mapping

| Slide Topic | Code Location | Status |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Linear LR Decay | `train.py` lines 88-114 | ✅ Documented |
| Doc Stride = 150 | All configs + `dataset.py` | ✅ Changed |
| Preprocessing (Center Answers) | `dataset.py` lines 40-105 | ✅ Implemented |
| Postprocessing (end < start) | `utils.py` lines 116-172 | ✅ Fixed |

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install accelerate==0.2.0
```

2. **Train with different levels**:
```bash
# Simple (basic settings)
python train.py --config configs/simple_config.json

# Medium (LR decay + doc_stride)
python train.py --config configs/medium_config.json

# Strong (better preprocessing + different models)
python train.py --config configs/strong_config.json

# Boss (ensemble + all improvements)
python train.py --config configs/boss_config.json
```

3. **Evaluate**:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path output/best_model --test_data data/test.json --config configs/medium_config.json
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### FP16 Training
- Only works on certain GPUs (T4, V100, A100, etc.)
- If you get errors, set `"use_fp16": false` in config
- Expected speedup: 2-3x faster

### Doc Stride
- Now set to 150 for all configurations
- This is the recommended value from the slide
- You can experiment with other values (64, 128, 200) if needed

### Answer Centering
- Only applied during **training** (not evaluation)
- Prevents model from learning boundary artifacts
- Critical for good generalization

### Postprocessing
- Always validates that start_index < end_index
- Skips invalid spans instead of crashing
- This was a common bug in previous implementations
